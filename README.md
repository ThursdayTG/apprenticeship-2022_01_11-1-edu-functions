We were formally taught about functions. Took us long enough, lol

It is not hard to see that I have been *somewhat* familiar with functions before. However, I found this lesson to be very helpful, as I have finally learnt what the stuff in the round brackets means that I've sometimes seen from other people. It wasn't hard for me to understand the utility of this.
