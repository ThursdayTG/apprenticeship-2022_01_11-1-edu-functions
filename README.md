We were formally taught about functions. Took us long enough, lol

It is not hard to see that I have been *somewhat* familiar with functions before. However, I found this lesson to be very helpful, as I have finally learnt what the stuff in the round brackets means that I've sometimes seen from other people. It wasn't hard for me to understand the utility of this.

As this was purely for educational purposes and the files are pretty chaotic with me having little reason and motivation to clean things up, I will not be bothering with releases here.
